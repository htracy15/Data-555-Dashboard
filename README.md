# Dashboard Description

The research topic this dashboard covers is investigating the association between county-level severe housing problems and excessive drinking rates amongst Medicare female breast cancer survivors. County-level severe housing problems were obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program, where the original variable was labeled as “severe housing outcomes” (Reminton et al., 2015; University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, 2021). The value is a county-level percentage, which is the percent of households in each U.S. county with at least 1 of 4 housing problems: overcrowding [more than 1 person per room], high housing costs [cost burden greater than 50%], incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Excessive drinking rates are defined as the percentage of adults reporting binge or heavy drinking (age-adjusted) within each county. These were annual measures from 2016-2020 originally from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

# Real-World Importance and Importance of Dashboard

This project is important because severe housing problems are a major environmental exposure and there is relatively little research currently on its relationships 
with negative health outcomes and behaviors such as excessive drinking. The findings will be used to better understand the associations between severe housing problems 
and excessive drinking rates, which can help inform housing and public health policies and programs.
