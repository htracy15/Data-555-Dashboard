# Dashboard Description

The dataset consists of three different datasets merged together: 
the Medicare denominator file, Chronic Conditions Warehouse data, and University of Madison-Wisconsin County Health Rankings data 
(the Medicare denominator file and Chronic Conditions Warehouse data are confidential but University of Madison-Wisconsin County Health Rankings data are public). 
The Medicare denominator and Chronic Conditions Warehouse data were collected by accessing it through the Emory Rollins High Computing Cluster Environment after 
obtaining access approval through Emory, while the county health rankings datasets were accessed by downloading them from the University of Madison-Wisconsin County 
Health Rankings website. The sample size of the data is 803,530 participants. The study population consists of female breast cancer survivors who were continuously 
enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B between 2016 - 2020 who have no history of depression and who did not move zip codes during the study duration. The Medicare and 
Chronic Conditions Warehouse data was collected continuously by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the United States and the County Health Rankings 
datasets were collected annually from U.S. counties through aggregating sources from websites like the Censusâ€™ American Community Survey, but the specific dataset in 
my ILE contains information from 2014 - 2020.

# Real-World Importance and Importance of Dashboard

This project is important because severe housing problems are a major environmental exposure and there is relatively little research currently on its relationships 
with negative health outcomes and behaviors such as excessive drinking. The findings will be used to better understand the associations between severe housing problems 
and excessive drinking rates, which can help inform housing and public health policies and programs.
